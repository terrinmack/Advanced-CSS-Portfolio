# Advanced CSS Coding Portfolio
## Using HTML and CSS
### Module 2 assignment- to create a html website from scratch using advanced css techniques.
### The criteria the portfolio needed to meet are: 
### 1. The name of developer, a photo or avatar, and a navigation bar to link to each designated section must be included.
### 2. Have the navigation bar be functional with a UI scroll.
### 3. The portfolio directory has functioning links with each listed project. 
### 4. The webpage works on various screens and devices.

<br>

### This portfolio goal is to be used as a "basecamp" for future projects completed. With time, the project directory will include more links to each new project or group projects done as time progresses.
